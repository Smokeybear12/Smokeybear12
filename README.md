# Salutations!

Hello! I am currently learning Java; I have no plans to continue with any other language at this point.

## In-Progress Projects:

### FencingF+2
#### Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 hacked client.
##### - First practical 2b2t.org / strict anti-cheat noslow bypass
##### - AutoPvP module with CrystalPvP capabilities
##### - Other private modules to be announced!
<br>

## Ideas / Concepts:

### Connect0:

#### A concept I came up with.

##### - If this project were to be a reality, it would allow for more realistic web indexing / searching
<br>

### USB Wrapper
#### A more realistic idea.
##### - I can't share details on this; it's a more private project.
<br>



# That's all! Team Rydon on Top!
