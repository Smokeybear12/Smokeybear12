# Salutations! 

Hello! My name is Andrew, and I am currently learning Java; I have no plans to continue with any other language at this point.

## In-Progress Projects:
### WorldEditCUI-1.18
#### Converting a 1.16.5 mod to 1.18.

<br>

## Ideas / Concepts:

### Connect0:

#### A concept I came up with.

##### - If this project were to be a reality, it would allow for more realistic web indexing / searching
<br>

### USB Wrapper
#### A more realistic idea.
##### - I can't share details on this; it's a more private project.
<br>

## Completed projects:
### FencingF+2 version 1.9.2
[Download](https://smokeybear12.github.io/fencingfplus2/v1.9.2)

### HydraWare cleaning and update

### Github pages testing
[Link to test](https://smokeybear12.github.io/fencingfplus2/)

### JackHeightLimit
#### Datapack to raise the height of the end dimension.(Can be buggy for survival; works well for creative)

# That's all! Team Rydon on Top!
